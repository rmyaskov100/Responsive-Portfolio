                <p>Hello, my name is Ruslan Myaskovskiy. I am a fullstack developer working for 60out.com, in Los Angeles, California. Due to my immersive love to coding, I have delved into numerous programming languages. My interest in designing and developing is what drove me to specialise in Fullstack Development.
                    <br>I offer fullstack solutions, employing cutting edge technologies. I like mobile-first responsive design and progressive enhancement. I find the process of shaping an online identity through engaging user interaction fascinating. Since an image is worth a thousand words, check out my portfolio for a variety of projects, which wont leave you silent.
                    <br>Some neat facts about me is that, I employ HTML semantics to improve screen-reader accessibility and SEO. I also use Bootstrap, as the starting point for my designs and take it from there with custom modifications. As far as functionality, I utilize ReactJS and Redux, with a functional approach, to deliver demanding frontend solutions.
